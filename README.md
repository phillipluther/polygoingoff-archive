# polygoingoff-archive

Once upon a time I had a podcast. It podfaded in early 2017. Since then, I've been paying a few bucks a month to keep the thing online. That few bucks a month adds up!

This is a quick/dirty static site/RSS builder to archive that old podcast. The HTML deploys to Netlify and the audio is hosted on archive.org.

Audio source files are not checked in for size considerations and because they're on archive.org.

## Isn't this a bit over-engineered?

No, it's _way_ over-engineered. In the temporary absence of other projects, though, building this simple-made-complicated thing was more fun than copy/pasting markup and assets from the old WordPress instance.
